# 69. Sqrt(x)

**Difficulty:** Easy

## Problem Statement

Given a non-negative integer `x`, return the square root of `x` rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.

You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: x = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: x = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned.
```

## Constraints

- `0 <= x <= 2^31 - 1`

## Solution Approach

Use binary search to find the square root. Search for the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to x.

**Time Complexity:** O(log n)
**Space Complexity:** O(1)
