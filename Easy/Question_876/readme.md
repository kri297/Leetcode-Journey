# 876. Middle of the Linked List

**Difficulty:** Easy

## Problem Statement

Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.

If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [3,4,5]
Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: [4,5,6]
Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.
```

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 100]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 100`

## Solution Approach

Use the fast and slow pointer technique (tortoise and hare algorithm). Move the fast pointer two steps and slow pointer one step. When fast pointer reaches the end, slow pointer will be at the middle.

**Time Complexity:** O(n)
**Space Complexity:** O(1)
